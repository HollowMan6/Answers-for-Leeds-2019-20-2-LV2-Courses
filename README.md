Due to the coronavirus pandemic at that time, we were not given numerical marks for that semester. Some courseworks at the later time were changed into formative.

# 交换期间利兹大学2019/20第二学期二年级课程 我的代码及答案

我在由2019年国家留学基金委优秀本科生国际交流项目(第二批)资助交换期间于利兹大学2019/20第二学期二年级课程和COMP1021课程的答案。

受当时新冠肺炎的影响，我们这学期没有给分数。后来的一些大作业被改为形成性评估。

这个仓库提供的内容旨在帮助那些在学习过程中遇到困难的课程学习者。作业和答案由本人做出。

测验和课程内容属于利兹大学及其创建的老师们。

请不要抄袭，抄袭在利兹大学是一种很严重的行为，可能导致课程零分！请遵守[学术诚信](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/vle/students/assess/academicintegrity/)，本人也对此类答案保留一切权利！
